# sup3rS3cretMes5age!

A simple, secure self-destructing message service, using HashiCorp Vault product as a backend.

Read more about the reasoning behind this project in the [relevant blog post](https://blog.algolia.com/secure-tool-for-one-time-self-destructing-messages/).

Now using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for simple and free SSL certs!

## Deployment

### Testing it locally

You can just run `docker-compose up --build`: it will build the Docker image and then run it alongside a standalone Vault server.

By default, the `docker-compose.yml` is configured to run the webapp on port 8082 in cleartext HTTP (so you can access it on [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)).

Optionally, you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` and tweak the options (enable HTTPS, disable HTTP or enable redirection to HTTPS, etc.). See [Configuration options](#configuration-options).

### Production Deployment

We recommend deploying the project via **Docker** and a **container orchestration tool**:
* Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`
* Host it in a Docker registry ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), etc.)
* Deploy the image (alongside with a standalone Vault server) using a container orchestration tool ([Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/), etc.)

You can read the [configuration examples](#configuration-examples) below.

### Security notice!

Whatever deployment method you choose, **you should always run this behind SSL/TLS**, otherwise secrets will be sent _unencrypted_!

Depending on your infrastructure/deployment, you can have **TLS termination** either _inside the container_ (see [Configuration examples - TLS](#tls)), or _before_ e.g. at a load balancer/reverse proxy in front of the service.
It is interesting to have TLS termination before the container so you don't have to manage the certificate/key there, but **make sure the network** between your TLS termination point and your container **is secure**.

## Configuration options

* `VAULT_ADDR`: address of the Vault server used for storing the temporary secrets.
* `VAULT_TOKEN`: Vault token used to authenticate to the Vault server.
* `SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTP_BINDING_ADDRESS`: HTTP binding address (e.g. `:80`).
* `SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTPS_BINDING_ADDRESS`: HTTPS binding address (e.g. `:443`).
* `SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTPS_REDIRECT_ENABLED`: whether to enable HTTPS redirection or not (e.g. `true`).
* `SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_TLS_AUTO_DOMAIN`: domain to use for "Auto" TLS, i.e. automatic generation of certificate with Let's Encrypt. See [Configuration examples - TLS - Auto TLS](#auto-tls).
* `SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_TLS_CERT_FILEPATH`: certificate filepath to use for "manual" TLS.
* `SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_TLS_CERT_KEY_FILEPATH`: certificate key filepath to use for "manual" TLS.

### Configuration examples

#### Plain HTTP
```bash
VAULT_ADDR: http://vault:8200
VAULT_TOKEN: root

SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTP_BINDING_ADDRESS: ":80"
```

#### TLS

##### Auto TLS
```bash
VAULT_ADDR: http://vault:8200
VAULT_TOKEN: root

SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTPS_BINDING_ADDRESS: ":443"
SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_TLS_AUTO_DOMAIN: "secrets.example.com"
```

##### Auto TLS with HTTP > HTTPS redirection
```bash
VAULT_ADDR: http://vault:8200
VAULT_TOKEN: root

SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTP_BINDING_ADDRESS: ":80"
SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTPS_BINDING_ADDRESS: ":443"
SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTPS_REDIRECT_ENABLED: "true"
SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_TLS_AUTO_DOMAIN: "secrets.example.com"
```

##### Manual TLS
```bash
VAULT_ADDR: http://vault:8200
VAULT_TOKEN: root

SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_HTTPS_BINDING_ADDRESS: ":443"
SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_TLS_CERT_FILEPATH: "/mnt/ssl/cert_secrets.example.com.pem"
SUPERSECRETMESSAGE_TLS_CERT_KEY_FILEPATH: "/mnt/ssl/key_secrets.example.com.pem"
```
